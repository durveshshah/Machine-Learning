# Machine-Learning

For classification problem in I-ELM use cifar_10 dataset:
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

This classification dataset is of CIFAR-10.
• There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. It has five training batches and 1 test batch.
• The dataset consists of 10 classes which I have computed as x in my code such as x0, x1…….x9.

UCI Dataset Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant
Dataset contains 9568 rows from a Combined Cycle Power Plant spanning a project for 6 years (2006 - 2011). This dataset will predict electrical energy output based on the number of features.
• This dataset includes 4 features and 1 output, there are four inputs.
• Features include Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Exhaust Vacuum (V).
• The output is Net hourly electrical energy output (PE)
